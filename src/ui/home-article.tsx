                mod. I created this site to make it easy to visually explore buildings by style and category.

                Start by selecting styles from the sidebar or searching for buildings. Click images to see
                alternative angles, and use the heart icon to save favorites.

            <h3>FAQ & Missing Stuff</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Vote</strong> for the next stylepack in the sidebar! Screenshotting styles takes some
                time, so new styles may take a while to be added. If you notice outdated/missing buildings, or
                have any other suggestions (like new features), send feedback using the button at the top
                right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently the screenshots are of the maximum level of the building. Taking screenshots of
                different levels would take too much time.
